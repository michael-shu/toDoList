#To Do List

https://michael-shu.github.io/toDoList/
This website is a to do list that allows you to add items, mark them as completed, move them to another list and finally remove them from that completed list. It implements bootstrap container, buttons, columns as well as dropdown tables in order to help make the page responsive to different screen widths.
